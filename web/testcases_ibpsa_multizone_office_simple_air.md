# Test Case Name
``multizone_office_simple_air``

# Brief Description
The test case represents one floor with five zones of a new construction
medium office building in Chicago, IL, USA with total floor area of 1662.66 m<sup>2</sup>.
There are four perimeter zones and one core zone, with each perimeter zone
having a window-to-wall ratio of 0.33.

The HVAC system is a single-duct multi-zone VAV system with terminal reheat with
one air handler.  The air handler cooling coil is served by an air-cooled
chiller while the heating coil and terminal box reheat coils are served by
an air-to-water heat pump.  The embedded controls for the air handler
include supply fan static pressure reset and drybulb economizer, while the
terminal box controls utilize single-maximum airflow control.
