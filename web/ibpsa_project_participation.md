# Participation
Participation is primarily envisioned to include software development,
including research methods, code implementation, code testing, and test
case creation, as well as control strategy performance benchmarking using BOPTEST and Project administration.
Please see the [workplan](/project1-boptest/ibpsa/project/workplan) for more details
on tasks and project organization.

Three participation levels are envisioned, to be approved annually by the
operating agent(s).  They are described and listed below.
