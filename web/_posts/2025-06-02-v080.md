This is a new development version that contains mostly maintenance updates. Highlights include:

- Add weather forecast uncertainty as new scenario options for dry bulb temperature and global horizontal irradiation. The corresponding new scenario keys are ``temperature_uncertainty`` and ``solar_uncertainty``, which can take values ``None`` (default), ``'low'``, ``'medium'``, or ``'high'``. A new scenario key ``seed`` is also added to set an integer seed for reproducible uncertainty generation. The uncertainty models are based on [Zheng et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1080/19401493.2025.2453537).
- Add support for test case compilation with ``parsing/parser.py`` using Dymola. The parser can take argument ``tool='Dymola'``. A user of the parser choosing Dymola requires access to a Dymola license with binary model export capability.
- Updates to the test case ``singlezone_commercial_hydronic`` that improve controllability, system sizing, and numerical robustness, which were made for the Adrenalin competition.  These changes do change benchmark results as described in the detailed release notes.
