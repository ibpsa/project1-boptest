This is a new development version that contains important software updates and new features. Highlights include:

- Refactored the deployment architecture so as to migrate [BOPTEST-Service](https://github.com/NREL/boptest-service) code to the BOPTEST repository and make it the only deployment architecture for BOPTEST.  Notable changes are for those who deploy and use BOPTEST locally, see the full [releasenotes.md](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/v0.7.0/releasenotes.md) for more details and updated repository [README](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/v0.7.0/README.md) for changes to local deployment and API.
- New Test Case added: ``multizone_office_simple_hydronic``.  This is a 2-zone typical office building in Brussels, Belgium, served by fan-coil units for space heating and cooling, air handling units for space ventilation, an air-source heat pump for hot water production, and an air-cooled chiller for chilled water production.
- Updates to test cases ``bestest_air``, ``bestest_hydronic``, and ``multizone_residential_hydronic`` to improve controllability.
- Added support to ``parsing/parser.py`` for test case compilation using [Modelon's OPTIMICA Compiler Toolkit (OCT)](https://help.modelon.com/latest/reference/oct/).
