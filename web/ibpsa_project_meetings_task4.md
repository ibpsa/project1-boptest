# BOPTEST webinar series

We are excited to host the BOPTEST webinar series! These sessions highlight the latest research and industry applications of BOPTEST and provide a platform for the community to share insights, address common challenges and explore innovative uses of the tool.

**Webinar Format:** Each session features two speakers, one from academia and one from industry, each presenting for 20 minutes, followed by a 10-minute Q&A.

### Webinar 3: Grid-interactive buildings

**Date and time:** March 26, 2025 - 15:00 UTC

**Presentations:**

*<u>Flavia de Andrade Pereira</u>* (University College London) will explore how demand flexibility controls can be made generalisable and portable across BOPTEST test cases and real-world buildings.

*<u>Lucas Bex </u>* (KU Leuven) will discuss simulation-based testing of control strategies for districts, introducing Yards, a simulation framework based on DOPTEST.

### Webinar 2: BOPTEST in action

**Date and time:** January 29, 2025 - 14:00 UTC

**Presentations:**

*<u>Yuan Gao</u>* (Kyushu University) demonstrates how BOPTEST can be integrated into studies on model predictive control and reinforcement learning.

*<u>Robert Lastinger & Aaron Fish</u>* (Distech Controls) explain how Distech is integrating BOPTEST into its applications testing and customer training programs and demonstrate how they have built open-source tooling to use their hardware to monitor and control BOPTEST testcases.

### Webinar 1: From parameter optimization to emulator development for improved building control modelling with BOPTEST

**Date and time:** November 27, 2024 - 09:00 UTC

**Presentations:**

*<u>Parastoo Mohebi</u>* (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) compares different parameter identification techniques for optimal control of building energy systems.

*<u>Dr. Iago Cupeiro Figueroa</u>* (Cupeiro Solucións Intelixentes de Enerxía) introduces the "multizone_office_simple_hydronic" emulator, a new BOPTEST model designed to address gaps in existing emulators when compared with real buildings.
