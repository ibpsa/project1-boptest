- ‚è∞ **Duration**: 3.5 hours

- üìù **Brief description**: This is an introductory, hands-on tutorial to guide you through usage of the BOPTEST framework and its Gym interface for performance benchmarking of control algorithms. This one is similar to the one of BS2023 workshop but is more extensive and elaborates further in the BOPTEST native API and its Gym interface.
The tutorial is split into four main parts:

    1. Presentation 1: Introduction to the BOPTEST project, goals and approach
    2. Exercise 1: Introductory hands-on tutorial on the software
    3. Presentation 2: MPC and RL examples in BOPTEST
    4. Exercise 2: Learning BOPTEST-Gym: the OpenAI-Gym interface of BOPTEST

#### BS2023 Workshop: Introduction to the BOPTEST Framework

- üóìÔ∏è **Last updated**: 2023/09/04

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Compatible with**: `BOPTEST-v0.4.0`, `BOPTEST-Gym-v0.4.0`

- ‚è∞ **Duration**: 1.5 hours

- üìù **Brief description**: This is an introductory, hands-on tutorial to guide you through the BOPTEST framework and its Gym interface for performance benchmarking of control algorithms. The first exercise is common to the one from the BS2021 workshop but the second exercise explains BOPTEST-Gym instead of diving further into the BOPTEST API. The overall time is also shorter. Therefore, this tutorial gives a faster (but less deep) intro to both BOPTEST and BOPTEST-Gym.
The tutorial is split into three main parts:

    1. Presentation 1: Introduction to the BOPTEST project, goals and approach
    2. Exercise 1: Introduction to the BOPTEST API and sample controller testing
    3. Exercise 2: Learning BOPTEST-Gym: the OpenAI-Gym interface of BOPTEST

#### CCAI2022 Workshop: BOPTEST-Gym - Building Control with RL using BOPTEST

- üóìÔ∏è **Last updated**: 2023/11/11

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Compatible with**: `BOPTEST-v0.5.0`,`BOPTEST-Gym-v0.5.0`

- üîó **Links**: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym/blob/master/docs/tutorials/CCAI_Summer_School_2022/Building_Control_with_RL_using_BOPTEST.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

- ‚è∞ **Duration**: 2.5 hours

- üé• **Video**: An explanatory video of this tutorial can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvCVQef_kctwCagA5QOVj7QljHQ1xKUQ/view?usp=sharing) for the CCAI2022 Summer School on August 18, 2022. The video starts with a one-hour lecture on the application of machine learning in buildings. The part of BOPTEST-Gym follows right after and lasts for 1.5 hours. Please note that the software version used in the video is `BOPTEST-v0.2.0.` The framework and tutorial have been updated since then so you may notice slight differences in the content and interface. However, the main concepts and explanation behind remains the same.

- üìù **Brief description**: This is an introductory, hands-on tutorial to guide you through the main concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) for controlling Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems for buildings.
It applies RL to a building emulator from BOPTEST using its BOPTEST-Gym interface.
Compared to other tutorials, this one dives focuses more into concepts of RL and elaborates further on the BOPTEST-Gym interface.
The tutorial has the following parts:

    1. Background on RL in buildings
    2. The OpenAI-Gym standard
    3. The BOPTEST framework
    4. Implementing RL for a building with BOPTEST-Gym
