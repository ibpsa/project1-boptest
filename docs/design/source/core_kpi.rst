Core KPI Specification and Calculation
======================================

Core KPIs
------------

The following KPI definitions constitute the core KPIs to be calculated
in every test case, and documentation of the KPI considered during the
development phase is provided in the Appendix (See :ref:`SecAppKpi`).
During the IBPSA expert meetings, these core KPIs have been selected as the most
representative and relevant indicators to compare different control
approaches for buildings. Additional KPIs may be calculated and used for
specific purposes, but the core KPIs are considered the basis for
assessing the performance of a controller. The definitions consist of a
description, mathematical formula for quantification, and KPI tagging
notation.  Note that floor areas used for normalization are calculated
according to the definitions of the
Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (see https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php)
and Residential Energy Consumption Survey (see https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2015/squarefootage/).

Peak district heating demand in a given period of time

   when accounting for the sum of all district heating equipment present in the test
   case HVAC system.

   :math:`kgCO_2/m^2` when accounting for the sum of all energy vectors in the test
   case HVAC system, each using an emission factor profile based on the source of energy.
   The emission factors are to be related with the energy mix associated with
   the location of the test case building. According to this, the
   CO2 emissions are calculated as:

   each using a price profile based on the source of energy and given tariff
   archetype.  Three tariff archetypes are defined:
   constant, moderately dynamic (e.g. day/peak and night/off-peak pricing),
   and highly dynamic (e.g. real-time pricing).

   The indoor air quality violation is the integral of the deviation of the

   quantified as:

   .. math:: \Phi(t_0, t_f) = \frac{\sum_{z\in \mathbb{Z}} \int_{t_0}^{t_f} \phi_z(t) dt}{N}

   .. math:: \phi_z(t)=\gamma_z(t)-\gamma_{r,z}(t), \quad if \quad\gamma_z(t)>\gamma_{r,z}(t)

   .. math:: \phi_z(t)=0, \quad if \quad \gamma_z(t) \leq \gamma_{r,z}(t)

   :math:`\Phi` is the total violation of carbon dioxide CO2
   concentration in :math:`ppmh` between the initial time :math:`t_0` and the final
   time :math:`t_f`. :math:`z` is the zone index out
   of :math:`N` zones in the building. :math:`\phi_z` is the deviation of measured
   zone CO2 concentration :math:`\gamma_z` from the zone CO2 concentration
   threshold :math:`\gamma_{r,z}`.

Computational time ratio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The computational time at simulation step :math:`k`, :math:`t_c(k)`, is the real time
   required by the controller to compute the control inputs between simulation
   steps :math:`k` and :math:`k-1`.  It needs to be shorter than the duration of the
   simulation step of that iteration, :math:`T_s(k)`.
   The ratio between :math:`t_c(k)` and :math:`T_s(k)` helps indicate the
   practicality of the controller as well as potential for increasing
   computational time.  This is called the computational time ratio.

   As the computational time and the simulation step duration may not be the
   same for every simulation step, an average of the computational time ratio from
   all of the simulation steps that take place between the initial time :math:`t_0`
   and the final time :math:`t_f` for which this KPI is calculated. Thus,
   the computational time ratio is computed as follows:

   .. math:: t(t_0,t_f) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{t_c(k)}{T_s(k)}}{n}

   Where :math:`n` is the number of simulation steps that take place between
   :math:`t_0` and :math:`t_f`.

Installation metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The installation metrics refer to the effort and cost required to get
   the controller settled and running. Many aspects play a role in this
   sense. They are intrinsically subjective and therefore require
   qualitative measures. Therefore, these metrics are provided by the
   controller developer in the form of a simple score
   according to the following categories.  These categories may be refined in
   the future.

.. csv-table:: Installation Metrics
   :file: tables/installation_metrics.csv
   :class: longtable
   :widths: 30,20,20,20,20,20,20
   :align: left

Maximum allowed capital cost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The maximum allowed capital cost is the installation cost that would
   lead to a maximum payback period of 5 years. The reason to calculate
   the maximum allowed capital cost instead of the payback period
   directly is because of the subjectiveness associated with the
   installation metrics. The qualitative nature of the installation
   metrics could hamper the quantification of the payback period. On the
   contrary, the maximum allowed capital cost to obtain a fixed payback
   period of 5 years can be objectively quantified if a baseline
   controller is established as a reference. First, the operational
   savings per year are calculated as:

   .. math:: S_{1 year} = C_{1 year}^{old}-C_{1 year}^{new}

   These savings are computed as the difference between the operational
   cost of the old controller (the baseline) and the new controller.
   Notice the way to calculate these costs is the same as defined in the
   total operational cost KPI defined before for a given time period of
   one year and the selected tariff. The maximum allowed capital cost
   for the controller to get a payback period of 5 years is then
   calculated as:

   .. math:: CAPEX_{max}^{5 years} = 5 S_{1 year}

   The judgement of whether it is worth to install the new controller
   relies on the BOPTEST user, who can use the objective quantification
   of this KPI to take the decision.

Calculation Module
---------------------

A KPI calculation module is implemented that calculates the core KPIs
during the test case simulation by computing KPIs on the fly in order to
provide feedback to the controller or only for informative purposes.
Upon deployment of the test case, the module first use the KPI JSON
(kpis.json) to associate model output names with the appropriate KPIs
through the specified KPI annotations.
