The goal of BOPTEST is to enable simulation-based testing and benchmarking of
advanced control strategies in buildings for researchers and industry.
This will occur through the development of:

1. Reference building emulation test cases that are available to all users.

2. Key performance indicators (KPI) that assess the performance of a control strategy.

3. Software platform to select and manage test cases, handle control and measurement data exchange between the userâ€™s control software and the building emulation, calculate KPIs, and generate reports.

4. Procedures for benchmarking and user guide for controls development testing.
