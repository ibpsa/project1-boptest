**Software Development and Installation Time** (measured in one person time),Less than one day,Between a day and a week,Between a week and a month,Between a month and three months,More than three months,*To be added by Control Developer*
**Hardware Installation Cost** (including extra-sensors and labor),There is not any extra cost,There is a negligible initial extra cost,The extra cost is less than 1% of the actual value of the building,The extra cost is estimated between 1% and 3% of the actual value of the building,The extra cost is estimated to be larger than 3% of the actual  value of the building,*To be added by Control Developer*
**Software Development and Installation Cost** (including any software licenses and labor),There is not any extra cost,There is a negligible initial extra cost,The extra cost is less than 1% of the actual value of the building,The extra cost is estimated between 1% and 3% of the actual value of the building,The extra cost is estimated to be larger than 3% of the actual  value of the building,*To be added by Control Developer*
**Installation Expertise and Operator Training Requirements**,Everyone can install the controller ,Everyone can install the controller after a short training course of less than one day,Everyone can install the controller after a short training course of less than one week,Specific engineering knowledge is required like programming skills plus a short training course of less than one week,Only experts and very advanced engineers are able to install the controller,*To be added by Control Developer*
**Intensity of Extra Excitations for Obtaining an Identification Dataset**,There is not any need to excite the building because no monitoring data is required or the data can be gathered from the building working as business as usual.,Slight excitations are required. These excitations may have a minor influence in the energy use and there is no need to vacate the building during the training period.  ,Slight excitations are required that may have a noticeable influence in the energy use but there is no need to vacate the building during the training period.,Intense excitations are required. There is a considerable influence in the energy use and/or a need to vacate the building during the training period.,Intensive excitations are required that can only be obtained from detailed simulation models.,*To be added by Control Developer*
**Required Length of Identification Dataset**,There is no need of training from monitoring data.,Less than one day.,Between a day and a week.,Between a week and a month.,Several months.,*To be added by Control Developer*
