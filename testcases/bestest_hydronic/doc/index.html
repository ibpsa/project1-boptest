<p>
This is a single zone residential hydronic system model
for WP 1.2 of IBPSA project 1.
</p>
<h3>Building Design and Use</h3>
<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>
This building envelope model corresponds to the BESTEST case 900 test case.
It consists of a single zone with a rectangular floor plan of 6 by 8 meters
and a height of 2.7 m. The zone further consists of two south-oriented windows
of 6 m2 each, which are modelled using a single window of 12 m2.
</p>
<h4>Constructions</h4>
<p>
The walls consist of 10 cm thick concrete blocks and 6 cm of foam insulation.
For more details see
IDEAS.Buildings.Validation.Data.Constructions.HeavyWall.
The floor consists of 8 cm of concrete and 1 m of insulation, representing a
perfectly insulated floor. The roof consists of a light construction and 11 cm
of fibreglass.
</p>
<h4>Occupancy schedules</h4>
<p>
The zone is occupied by one person before 7 am and after 8 pm each weekday
and full time during weekends.
</p>
<h4>Internal loads and schedules</h4>
<p>
There are no internal loads other than the occupants.
</p>
<h4>Climate data</h4>
<p>
The model uses a climate file containing one year
of weather data for Brussels, Belgium.
</p>
<h3>HVAC System Design</h3>
<h4>Primary and secondary system designs</h4>
<p>
The model only has a primary heating system that heats the zone using a
single radiator with thermostatic valve, a circulation pump and a water heater.
The system is presented in Figure 1 below.
The radiator nominal thermal power and heater maximum thermal power is 5 kW.
The heating setpoint is set to 21 &#176;C during occupied
periods and 15 &#176;C during unoccupied periods. The cooling setpoint is set to
24 &#176;C during occupied peridos and 30 &#176;C during unoccupied periods.
The gas heater efficiency is computed using a polynomial curve and it uses a PI
controller to modulate supply water temperature between 20 and 80 &#176;C to
track a reference for the operative zone temperature
that equals the heating setpoint plus an offset
of 0.1 &#176;C by default.

</p>
<h4>Equipment specifications and performance maps</h4>
<p>
The heating system circulation pump has the default efficiency of the pump
model, which is 49%; at the time of writing. The heater efficiency is
computed using a polynomial curve.
</p>
<h4>Rule-based or local-loop controllers (if included)</h4>
<p>
The model assumes a pump with a constant head,
which results in a fixed flow rate due to the fixed pressure drop coefficient of the radiator.
The supply water temperature set point of the boiler is modulated using a PI
controller that tracks zone operative temperature to follow the zone operative temperature setpoint,
depicted as controller C1 in Figure 1 and shown in Figure 2 below.
For baseline control, this setpoint is defined as
the heating comfort setpoint plus an offset of 0.1 &#176;C.
The pump is switched on and off with hysteresis based on the indoor
temperature with the heating set point as the low point and the cooling set point
as the high point.  It is assumed that the boiler exactly
outputs the supply water temperature set point using an ideal controller
depicted as C2 in Figure 1.
