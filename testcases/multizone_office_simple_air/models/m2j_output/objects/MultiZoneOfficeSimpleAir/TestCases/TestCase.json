The primary local-loop controllers are specified on the diagram above\nas C1 to C3.\n</p>\n<p>\nC1 is responsible for maintaining the zone temperature setpoints as\ndetermined by the operating mode of the system and implements\ndual-maximum logic, as shown in the Figure below.  It takes\nas inputs the zone temperature heating and cooling setpoints and zone temperature\nmeasurement, and outputs the desired airflow rate of the damper and position\nof the reheat valve.  Seperate PI controllers (both k = 0.1 and Ti = 120 s)\nare used for control of the\ndamper airflow for cooling and reheat valve position for heating.  If the\nzone requires heating, the desired airflow rate of the damper is mapped\nto the specified maximum value for heating.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\n<img alt=\\\"Controller C1.\\\"\nsrc=\\\"modelica://MultiZoneOfficeSimpleAir/../../doc/images/C1.png\\\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nC2 is responsible for maintaining the duct static pressure setpoint\nand implements a duct static pressure reset strategy.  The first step of\nthe controller takes as input all of the terminal box damper positions and\noutputs a duct static pressure setpoint using a PI controller (k = 0.1 and Ti = 60 s)\nsuch that the maximum damper position is maintained at 0.9.\nThe second step then maintains\nthis setpoint using a PI controller (k = 0.5 and Ti = 15 s)\nand measured duct static pressure as input\nto output a fan speed setpoint.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\n<img alt=\\\"Controller C2.\\\"\nsrc=\\\"modelica://MultiZoneOfficeSimpleAir/../../doc/images/C2.png\\\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nC3 is responsible for maintaining the supply air temperature setpoint as well\nas the minimum outside air flow rate as determined by the operating mode\nof the system.  It takes as inputs the\nsupply air temperature setpoint, supply air temperature measurement, outside\ndrybulb temperature measurement, and supply fan speed.  The first part\nof the controller uses a PI controller (k = 0.01, Ti = 120 s) for supply air temperature setpoint\ntracking to output a signal that is then mapped to position\nsetpoints for the heating coil valve, cooling coil valve, and outside air\ndamper position.  If the heating valve is commanded to open and the supply\nfan is determined to be enabled\n(either by schedule or by supply air flow detection of at least 5% design air flow),\nthe heating coil pump is enabled.  Similar for cooling coil.\nThe second part of the controller uses a map to determine the minimum outside air\ndamper position for the given fan speed to provide minimum outside air requirements.\nInterpolation points for the map are assumed to be provided during commissioning and are\ngiven as follows.  For a fan speed of 0.44, the minimum outside air damper position is 0.47.\nFor a fan speed of 1.0, the minimum position is 0.32.\nThe maximum of the two outside air damper position\nsignals is finally output to ensure at least enough enough airflow is delivered\nfor ventilation when needed.  The economizer is enabled only if the outside\ndrybulb temperature is lower than the return air temperature.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\n<img alt=\\\"Controller C3.\\\"\nsrc=\\\"modelica://MultiZoneOfficeSimpleAir/../../doc/images/C3.png\\\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlso present, but not depicted in the diagrams above, is a freeze stat controller.\nThis controller detects potentially freezing conditions by measuring the\nmixed air temperature and determining if it is less than a limit, 3 degC.\nIf true, the controller will fully open the heating coil valve and enable the\nheating coil pump.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Model IO's</h3>\n<h4>Inputs</h4>\nThe model inputs are:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>hvac_oveAhu_TSupSet_u</code> [K] [min=285.15, max=313.15]: Supply air temperature
