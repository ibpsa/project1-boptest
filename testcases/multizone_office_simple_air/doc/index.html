<h3>General</h3>
This is the multi zone office air simple emulator model
of BOPTEST, emulating a 5-zone single-duct VAV system.
It is based on the Modelica model
<a href=\"https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/latest/help/Buildings_Examples_VAVReheat.html#Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006\"><code>Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006</code></a>.
with the addition of CO2 concentration tracking,
variable efficiency heat pump model, variable efficiency chiller model,
and BOPTEST signal exchange blocks.  The emphasis is on the control of
the air distribution system and not on the control of the
central plant equipment providing
hot and chilled water to the distribution system.
</p>
<h3>Building Design and Use</h3>
<h4>Architecture</h4>
<p>
The test case represents the middle floor of an office building
located in Chicago, IL, as described in the set of DOE
Commercial Building Benchmarks for new construction (Deru et al, 2009) and
shown in the figure below.  The represented floor has five zones, with
four perimeter zones and one core zone. Each perimeter zone
has a window-to-wall ratio of 0.33.  The height of each zone is 2.74 m
and the areas are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
North and South: 207.58 m<sup>2</sup>
</li>
<li>
East and West: 131.416 m<sup>2</sup>
</li>
<li>
Core: 984.672 m<sup>2</sup>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The upper and lower boundaries of the zones (top of zone air volume and bottom of 0.1 m floor concrete slab)
assume the corresponding zones of the floor above and the
floor below are at the same conditions as the middle floor.  Therefore,
the roof and the ground floor with exposure to ambient conditions
are not explicitly modeled.  The zones on the floor are assumed to be paritioned
by internal walls with 10 m by 2.1 m openings, through which air is exchanged.

<h4>Constructions</h4>
<p>
The envelope thermal properties meet ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004.
</p>
<h4>Occupancy schedules</h4>
<p>
The design occupancy density is 0.05 people/m<sup>2</sup>.  The number of occupants
present in each zone at any time coincides with the internal gain schedule
defined in the next section.
The occupied time for the HVAC system is between 6 AM and 7 PM each day.  The
unoccupied time is outside of this period.
</p>
<h4>Internal loads and schedules</h4>
<p>
The design internal gains including lighting, plug loads, and people
are combined 20 W/m<sup>2</sup> with a radiant-convective-latent split of 40%-40%-20%.
The internal gains are activated according to the schedule in the figure below.
</p>

</p>
<h4>Climate data</h4>
<p>
The weather data is from TMY3 for Chicago O'Hare International Airport.
</p>
<h3>HVAC System Design</h3>
<h4>Primary and secondary system designs</h4>
<p>
The HVAC system is a multi-zone single-duct Variable Air Volume (VAV) system
with pressure-independent terminal boxes with reheat.
A schematic of the system is shown in the
figure below.  The cooling and heating coils are water-based served by an
air-cooled chiller and air-to-water heat pump respectively.
The available sensor and control points, marked
on the figure below and described in more detail in the Section Model IO's,
are those specified as required by ASHRAE Guideline 36 2018
Section 4 List of Hardwired Points, specifically
Table 4.2 VAV Terminal Unit with Reheat and Table 4.6 Multiplie-Zone VAV Air
Handling Unit, as well as some that are specified as
application specific or optional.
</p>
<p align=\"center\">
<img alt=\"Schematic of HVAC system.\"

</p>
<h4>Equipment specifications and performance maps</h4>
<p>
The terminal box dampers have exponential opening characteristics with design
airflow rates defined in the table below.  The design system airflow rate includes
a 0.7 load diversity factor and is defined in the table below.

The minimum outside airflow for each zone is calculated using outside
airflow rates of 0.3e-3 m<sup>3</sup>/s-m<sup>2</sup> and 2.5e-3 m<sup>3</sup>/s-person.  The limiting
zone air distribution effectiveness is 0.8 and the occupant diversity
ratio is 0.7.  This leads to the minimum outside airflow rates for each zone
and system defined in the table below.

<p>
The supply fan hydraulic efficiency is constant at 0.7 and the motor
efficiency is constant at 0.7.  The cooling coil is served by an air-cooled
chiller supplying 6 degC water with varying COP according to a
York YCAL0033EE chiller as modeled by the ElectricEIR model with
coefficients defined in EnergyPlus v9.4.0.
The peak design load on the chiller is 101 kW, equal to the
design load on the cooling coil.  A chilled water distribution pump circulates water
from the chiller with a design head of 45 kPa and design mass flow equal to that of the chiller of 4.3 kg/s.
The heating coil and terminal box reheat coils are served by a single air-to-water
heat pump supplying 45 degC water with varying COP as 0.3 of
the carnot COP.  The peak design load on the
heat pump is 122 kW, equal to sum of design loads on the heating coil
in the AHU plus zone terminal box reheat coils multiplied by a load diversity factor
of 0.85.  A hot water distribution pump circulates water
from the heat pump with a design head of 45 kPa and design mass flow equal to that of the heat pump of 2.9 kg/s.
</p>
<h4>Rule-based or local-loop controllers (if included)</h4>
<p>
The baseline control emulates a typical scheme seen in practice and is based on
the ASHRAE VAV 2A2-21232 of the Sequences of Operation for Common HVAC Systems 2006
as well as that which is implemented as baseline control in the Modelica Buildings
Library model
<a href=\"https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/latest/help/Buildings_Examples_VAVReheat.html#Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006\"><code>Buildings.Examples.VAVReheat.ASHRAE2006</code></a>.
Setpoints and equipment enable/disable are determined by a schedule-based supervisory control
scheme that defines a set of operating modes.  This scheme is summarized in
Table 2 below.  An addition is made in this implementation from the one in Modelica Buildings Library
to add an Unoccupied Night Set Up mode, which allows for the system turning on
during unoccupied hours to maintain a cooling set point.

<p>
Once the operating mode is determined, a number of low-level, local-loop
controllers are used to maintain the desired setpoints using the available
actuators.  The primary local-loop controllers are specified on the diagram above
as C1 to C3.
</p>
<p>
C1 is responsible for maintaining the zone temperature setpoints as
determined by the operating mode of the system and implements
dual-maximum logic, as shown in the Figure below.  It takes
as inputs the zone temperature heating and cooling setpoints and zone temperature
measurement, and outputs the desired airflow rate of the damper and position
of the reheat valve.  Seperate PI controllers (both k = 0.1 and Ti = 120 s)
are used for control of the
damper airflow for cooling and reheat valve position for heating.  If the
zone requires heating, the desired airflow rate of the damper is mapped
to the specified maximum value for heating.
</p>

<p align=\"center\">
<img alt=\"Controller C1.\"
src="images/C1.png"/>
</p>

<p>
C2 is responsible for maintaining the duct static pressure setpoint
and implements a duct static pressure reset strategy.  The first step of
the controller takes as input all of the terminal box damper positions and
outputs a duct static pressure setpoint using a PI controller (k = 0.1 and Ti = 60 s)
such that the maximum damper position is maintained at 0.9.
The second step then maintains
this setpoint using a PI controller (k = 0.5 and Ti = 15 s)
and measured duct static pressure as input
to output a fan speed setpoint.
</p>

<p align=\"center\">
<img alt=\"Controller C2.\"
src="images/C2.png"/>
</p>

<p>
C3 is responsible for maintaining the supply air temperature setpoint as well
as the minimum outside air flow rate as determined by the operating mode
of the system.  It takes as inputs the
supply air temperature setpoint, supply air temperature measurement, outside
drybulb temperature measurement, and supply fan speed.  The first part
of the controller uses a PI controller (k = 0.01, Ti = 120 s) for supply air temperature setpoint
tracking to output a signal that is then mapped to position
setpoints for the heating coil valve, cooling coil valve, and outside air
damper position.  If the heating valve is commanded to open and the supply
fan is determined to be enabled
(either by schedule or by supply air flow detection of at least 5% design air flow),
the heating coil pump is enabled.  Similar for cooling coil.
The second part of the controller uses a map to determine the minimum outside air
damper position for the given fan speed to provide minimum outside air requirements.
Interpolation points for the map are assumed to be provided during commissioning and are
given as follows.  For a fan speed of 0.44, the minimum outside air damper position is 0.47.
For a fan speed of 1.0, the minimum position is 0.32.
The maximum of the two outside air damper position
signals is finally output to ensure at least enough enough airflow is delivered
for ventilation when needed.  The economizer is enabled only if the outside
drybulb temperature is lower than the return air temperature.
</p>

<p align=\"center\">
<img alt=\"Controller C3.\"
src="images/C3.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Also present, but not depicted in the diagrams above, is a freeze stat controller.
This controller detects potentially freezing conditions by measuring the
mixed air temperature and determining if it is less than a limit, 3 degC.
If true, the controller will fully open the heating coil valve and enable the
heating coil pump.

<h3>Additional System Design</h3>
<h4>Lighting</h4>
<p>
Lighting heat gain is included in the internal heat gains and is not controllable.
</p>
<h4>Shading</h4>
<p>
There is no shading on this building.
</p>
<h4>Onsite Generation and Storage</h4>
<p>
There is no onsite generation or storage on this building site.
</p>
<h3>Model Implementation Details</h3>
<h4>Moist vs. dry air</h4>
<p>
A moist air model is used.  Relative humidity is tracked based on latent
heat gain from occupants, outside air relative humidity, and a cooling
coil model that includes condensation.
</p>
<h4>Pressure-flow models</h4>
<p>
The duct airflow is modeled using a pressure-flow network.  Air exchange between
zones is modeled through an open door model implemented with
<a href=\"https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v8.0.0/help/Buildings_Airflow_Multizone.html#Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.DoorOpen\"><code>Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.DoorOpen</code></a>.
</p>
<h4>Infiltration models</h4>
<p>
Airflow due to infiltration is calculated based on time-varying
wind pressure coefficients for each facade using
<a href=\"https://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica/releases/v8.0.0/help/Buildings_Fluid_Sources.html#Buildings.Fluid.Sources.Outside_CpLowRise\"><code>Buildings.Fluid.Sources.Outside_CpLowRise</code></a>.
</p>
<h4>CO2 models</h4>
<p>
CO2 generation is 0.0048 L/s per person (Table 5, Persily and De Jonge 2017)
and density of CO2 assumed to be 1.8 kg/m<sup>3</sup>,
making CO2 generation 8.64e-6 kg/s per person.
Outside air CO2 concentration is 400 ppm.
