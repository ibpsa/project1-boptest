The windows are double pane clear 3.175mm glass with 13mm air gap.
</p>

<h4>Occupancy schedules</h4>
<p>
There is maximum occupancy (two people) from 8am to 6pm each day,
and no occupancy during all other times.
</p>
<h4>Internal loads and schedules</h4>
<p>
The internal heat gains from plug loads come mainly from computers and monitors.
The internal heat gains from lighting come from hanging fluorescent fixtures.
Both types of loads are at maximum during occupied periods and 0.1 maximum
during all other times.  The occupied heating and cooling temperature
setpoints are 21 C and 24 C respectively, while the unoccupied heating
and cooling temperature setpoints are 15 C and 30 C respectively.

</p>
<h4>Climate data</h4>
<p>
The climate is assumed to be near Denver, CO, USA with a latitude and
longitude of 39.76,-104.86.  The climate data comes from the
Denver-Stapleton,CO,USA,TMY.
</p>
<h3>HVAC System Design</h3>
<h4>Primary and secondary system designs</h4>
<p>
Heating and cooling is provided to the office using an idealized four-pipe
fan coil unit (FCU), presented in Figure 1 below.
The FCU contains a fan, cooling coil, heating coil,
and filter.  The fan draws room air into the unit, blows it over the coils
and through the filter, and supplies the conditioned air back to the room.
There is a variable speed drive serving the fan motor.  The cooling coil
is served by chilled water produced by a chiller and the heating coil is
served by hot water produced by a gas boiler.

</p>

<p>
<br>
</p>

<h4>Equipment specifications and performance maps</h4>
<p>
For the fan, the design airflow rate is 0.55 kg/s and design pressure rise is
185 Pa.  The fan and motor efficiencies are both constant at 0.7.
The heat from the motor is added to the air stream.

The COP of the chiller is assumed constant at 3.0.  The efficiency of the
gas boiler is assumed constant at 0.9.
</p>
<h4>Rule-based or local-loop controllers (if included)</h4>
<p>
A baseline thermostat controller provides heating and cooling as necessary
to the room by modulating the supply air temperature and
fan speed.  The thermostat, designated as C1 in Figure 1 and shown in Figure 2 below,
uses two different PI controllers for heating and
cooling, each taking the respective zone temperature set point and zone
temperature measurement as inputs.  The outputs are used to control supply air
temperature set point and fan speed according to the map shown in Figure 3 below.
The supply air temperature is exactly met by the coils using an ideal controller
depicted as C2 in Figure 1.
For heating, the maximum supply air temperature is 40 C and the minimum is the
zone occupied heating temperature setpoint.  For cooling, the minimum supply
air temperature is 12 C and the maximum is the zone occupied cooling
temperature setpoint.

<h3>Additional System Design</h3>
<h4>Lighting</h4>
<p>
Artificial lighting is provided by hanging fluorescent fixtures.
</p>
<h4>Shading</h4>
<p>
There are no shades on the building.
</p>
<h4>Onsite Generation and Storage</h4>
<p>
There is no energy generation or storage on the site.
</p>
<h3>Model Implementation Details</h3>
<h4>Moist vs. dry air</h4>
<p>
A moist air model is used, but condensation is not modeled on the cooling coil
and humidity is not monitored.

</p>
<h4>Pressure-flow models</h4>
<p>
The FCU fan is speed-controlled and the resulting flow is calculated based
on resulting pressure rise by the fan and fixed pressure drop of the system.
</p>
<h4>Infiltration models</h4>
<p>
A constant infiltration flowrate is assumed to be 0.5 ACH.
</p>
<h4>Other assumptions</h4>
<p>
The supply air temperature is directly specified.
</p>
<p>
CO2 generation is 0.0048 L/s per person (Table 5, Persily and De Jonge 2017)
and density of CO2 assumed to be 1.8 kg/m^3,
making CO2 generation 8.64e-6 kg/s per person.
Outside air CO2 concentration is 400 ppm.  However, CO2 concentration
is not controlled for in the model.
