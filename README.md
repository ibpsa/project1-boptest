# IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST
Building Optimization Performance Tests

This repository contains prototype code for the Building Optimization Performance Test framework (BOPTEST)
that is being developed as part of the IBPSA Project 1 (https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/).

## Structure
- ``/testcase#`` contains prototype code for a test case, including docs, models, and configuration settings.
- ``/examples`` contains prototype code for interacting with a test case and running example tests with simple controllers.  Those controllers are implemented in both Python (Version 2.7) and Julia (Version 1.0.3).
- ``/parsing`` contains prototype code for a script that parses a Modelica model using signal exchange blocks and outputs a wrapper FMU and KPI json.
- ``/template`` contains template Modelica code for a test case emulator model.
- ``/testing`` contains code for unit and functional testing of this software.  See the README there for more information about running these tests.

## Run Prototype Test Cases
1) Build the test case by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make build`` where # is the number of the test case to build.
2) Deploy the test case by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make run`` where # is the number of the test case that has been built.
3) In a separate process, use the test case API defined below to interact with the test case.
4) Run an example controller test: 

* For Python based controllers:
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ python examples/python/twoday_p.py`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the testcase1 over a two-day period.
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ python examples/python/szvav_sup.py`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the testcase2 over a two-day period.

* For Julia based controllers:
  * install docker compose based on the instruction from https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/, then
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/julia && Script=twoday_p docker-compose up`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the testcase1 over a two-day period.
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/julia && Script=szvav_sup docker-compose up`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the testcase2 over a two-day period.
  * once the test is done, use ``docker-compose down`` to stop containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by ``docker-compose up``.

5) Shutdown test case container by slecting container terminal window and ``Ctrl+C`` to close port, ``Ctrl+D`` to exit docker container.
6) Remove the test case image by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make remove-image``.

## Test Case RESTful API
- To interact, send RESTful requests to: ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/<request>``

Example RESTful interaction:

- Receive a list of available measurement names and their metadata: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/measurements``
- Advance simulation of test case 2 with new heating and cooling temperature setpoints: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/advance -d '{"oveTSetRooHea_u":293.15,"oveTSetRooHea_activate":1, "oveTSetRooCoo_activate":1,"oveTSetRooCoo_u":298.15}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"``.  Leave an empty json to advance the simulation using the setpoints embedded in the model.

|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Advance simulation with control input and receive measurements |  POST ``advance`` with json data "{<input_name>:<value>}" |

| Receive communication step in seconds                          |  GET ``step``                                             |
| Set communication step in seconds                              |  PUT ``step`` with data ``step=<value>``                  |
| Receive sensor signal names (y) and metadata                   |  GET ``measurements``                                     |
| Receive control signals names (u) and metadata                 |  GET ``inputs``                                           |
| Receive test result data                                       |  GET ``results``                                          |
