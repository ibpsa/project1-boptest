# IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST

Building Optimization Performance Tests

This repository contains prototype code for the Building Optimization Performance Test framework (BOPTEST)
that is being developed as part of the IBPSA Project 1 (https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/).

## Structure
- ``/testcases`` contains test cases, including docs, models, and configuration settings.
- ``/examples`` contains prototype code for interacting with a test case and running example tests with simple controllers.  Those controllers are implemented in both Python (Version 2.7), Julia (Version 1.0.3) and Javascript (Version ECMAScript 2018).
- ``/parsing`` contains prototype code for a script that parses a Modelica model using signal exchange blocks and outputs a wrapper FMU and KPI json.
- ``/template`` contains template Modelica code for a test case emulator model.
- ``/testing`` contains code for unit and functional testing of this software.  See the README there for more information about running these tests.
- ``/data`` contains prototype code for generating and managing data associated with test cases.  This includes boundary conditions, such as weather, schedules, and energy prices, as well as a map of test case FMU outputs needed to calculate KPIs.
- ``/forecast`` contains prototype code for returning boundary condition forecast, such as weather, schedules, and energy prices.
- ``/kpis`` contains prototype code for calculating key performance indicators.
- ``/docs`` contains design requirements and guide documentation.

## Run Prototype Test Cases
1) Build the test case by ``$ make build TESTCASE=testcase#`` where # is the number of the test case to build from ``testcases``.
2) Deploy the test case by ``$ make run TESTCASE=testcase#`` where # is the number of the test case that has been built from ``testcases``.
3) In a separate process, use the test case API defined below to interact with the test case.
4) Run an example controller test: 

* For Python based controllers:
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ python examples/python/twoday_p.py`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the testcase1 over a two-day period.
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ python examples/python/szvav_sup.py`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the testcase2 over a two-day period.

* For Julia based controllers:
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/julia && make build Script=twoday_p && make run Script=twoday_p`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the testcase1 over a two-day period.
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/julia && make build Script=szvav_sup && make run Script=szvav_sup`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the testcase2 over a two-day period.
  * once the test is done, use ``$ make remove-image Script=twoday_p`` or ``$ make remove-image Script=szvav_sup`` to removes containers, networks, volumes, and images.
  
* For Javascript based controllers:
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/javascript && make build Script=twoday_p && make run Script=twoday_p`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the testcase1 over a two-day period.
  * in a separate terminal, use ``$ cd examples/javascript && make build Script=szvav_sup && make run Script=szvav_sup`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the testcase2 over a two-day period.
  * once the test is done, use ``$ make remove-image Script=twoday_p`` or ``$ make remove-image Script=szvav_sup`` to removes containers, networks, volumes, and images.  
  
5) Shutdown test case container by slecting container terminal window and ``Ctrl+C`` to close port, ``Ctrl+D`` to exit docker container.
6) Remove the test case image by ``$ make remove-image TESTCASE=testcase#``.

## Test Case RESTful API
- To interact, send RESTful requests to: ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/<request>``

Example RESTful interaction:

- Receive a list of available measurement names and their metadata: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/measurements``
- Receive a forecast of boundary condition data: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/forecast``
- Advance simulation of test case 2 with new heating and cooling temperature setpoints: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/advance -d '{"oveTSetRooHea_u":293.15,"oveTSetRooHea_activate":1, "oveTSetRooCoo_activate":1,"oveTSetRooCoo_u":298.15}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"``.  Leave an empty json to advance the simulation using the setpoints embedded in the model.
