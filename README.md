# IBPSA Project 1 - BOPTEST
Building Optimization Performance Tests

This repository contains prototype code for the Building Optimization Performance Test framework (BOPTEST)
that is being developed as part of the IBPSA Project 1 (https://ibpsa.github.io/project1/).

## Structure
- ``/testcase#`` contains prototype code for a test case, including docs, models, and configuration settings.
- ``/examples`` contains prototype code for interacting with a test case and running example tests with simple controllers.
- ``/parsing`` contains prototype code for a script that parses a Modelica model using signal exchange blocks and outputs a wrapper FMU and KPI json.
- ``/template`` contains template Modelica code for a test case emulator model.
- ``/testing`` contains code for unit and functional testing of this software.  See the README there for more information about running these tests.

## Run Prototype Test Cases
1) Build the test case image by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make build`` where # is the number of the test case to build.
2) Deploy the test case container by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make run`` where # is the number of the test case that has been built.
3) In a seperate process, use the test case API defined below to interact with the test case.
4) Run an example controller test:

- For testcase1, in a separate terminal use ``$ python examples/twoday_p.py`` to test a simple proportional feedback controller on the test case over a two-day period.
- For testcase2, in a separate terminal use ``$ python examples/szvav_sup.py`` to test a simple supervisory controller on the test case over a two-day period.

5) Shutdown test case container by slecting container terminal window and ``Ctrl+C`` to close port, ``Ctrl+D`` to exit docker container.
6) Remove the test case image by ``$ TESTCASE=testcase# make remove-image``.

## Test Case RESTful API
- To interact, send RESTful requests to: ``http://127.0.0.1:5000/<request>``

Example RESTful interaction:

- Receive a list of available measurement names and their metadata: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/measurements``
- Advance simulation of test case 2 with new heating and cooling temperature setpoints: ``$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/advance -d '{"oveTSetRooHea_u":293.15,"oveTSetRooHea_activate":1, "oveTSetRooCoo_activate":1,"oveTSetRooCoo_u":298.15}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"``.  Leave an empty json to advance the simulation using the setpoints embedded in the model.

| Set communication step in seconds                              |  PUT ``step`` with data ``step=<value>``                  |
| Receive sensor signal names (y) and metadata                   |  GET ``measurements``                                     |
| Receive control signals names (u) and metadata                 |  GET ``inputs``                                           |

| Receive test KPIs                                              |  GET ``kpi``                                              |
| Receive test case name                                         |  GET ``name``                                             |
