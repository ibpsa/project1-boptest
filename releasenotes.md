# Release Notes

## BOPTEST v0.2.0

Released on 03/05/2022.

**The following changes are backwards-compatible and do not significantly change benchmark results:**

- Make the test case parser compatible wth python 3.  This is for [#404](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/404).
- Use ``docker-compose`` for building and running test case.  Use of ``make build`` and ``make run`` deprecated.  See ``README.md`` for new deployment instructions.  This is for [#365](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/365).
- Posted developer tutorial given to IBPSA Project 1 WP1.2 during Rome expert meeting and updated for current version of BOPTEST.  Located at ``docs/tutorials/tutorial1_developer/BOPTEST_Tutorial1_developer_20220110.pdf``.  This is for [#358](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/358).
- For ``multizone_residential_hydronic``, correct one-port temperature sensors to two-port and update door models from ``Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.DoorDiscretizedOperable`` to ``Buildings.Airflow.Multizone.DoorDiscretizedOpen``.  This is for [#384](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/384).
- Refactor python-based example tests to utilize a single BOPTEST interface script.  This is for [#279](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/279).
- Fix ``data/data_generator`` to produce correct set points for defined occupied and unnoccupied times. This is for [#368](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/368).
- Freeze IBPSA Modelica library version in creation of ``jm`` image for unit testing.  This is for [#371](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/371).
- Update test cases to use Buildings v8.0.0 and IDEAS v2.2.1 commit f1fdd8b.  This is for [#362](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/362) and [#364](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/364).
- Add content to ``/docs/workshops`` for workshop at IBPSA Building Simulation 2021 Conference.  This is for [#348](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/348) and [#374](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/374).
- Update README.md to add links to ``boptest-service`` and ``boptest-gym``.  This is for [#353](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/353).
- Fix path for documentation images for bestest_hydronic_heat_pump test case.  This is for [#351](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/351).

**The following changes are backwards-compatible but do change benchmark results:**

- Correct calculation of mix day scenario in ``/data/find_days.py``.  This changes the reference day for the mix day scenario time period for the ``bestest_air`` test case.  This is for [#381](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/381).

**The following changes are not backwards-compatible but do not significantly change benchmark results:**

- Fix so that data returned through the API using ``/results`` and ``/advance`` for ``<control_signal_name>_u`` represents the "current value" of the control signal utilized within the emulator.  It is equal to the baseline controller value if not being overwritten and the overwritten value otherwise.  While this change does not change benchmark results, it is not backward compatible since the measurement signals available in some test cases that reported such "current values" (e.g. ``reaTSetHea_y`` in ``bestest_hydronic``) have been removed.  Users should instead request data for the control signal ``<control_signal_name>_u`` (e.g. ``oveTSetHea_u`` in ``bestest_hydronic``).  This is for [#364](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/364).

**The following new test cases have been added:**

- ``singlezone_commercial_hydronic``, a single-zone commercial hydronic model with district heating source, zone radiator, and air handling unit providing fresh air with CO2 control and heat recovery.  This is for [#162](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/issues/162).
